### Improvements to be made: (Timed Questions)

![Advanced](Images/2-advanced.jpg)

**[Click Here to Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/xhmmiRmxQ8Q)**.

- [ ] Revamp the trivia game so that only one question shows until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- [ ] If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

- [ ] The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  - [ ] If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  - [ ] If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

- [ ] On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
